# Takes a JSON payload from a Github PR issue webhook from stdin, reads the
# comment, and if it matches `!bump (major|minor|patch)`, merges the PR, bumps
# the Chef cookbook's metadata.rb, creates a version tag, and pushes up.
#
# Additionally, will pass environments to bump to the environment bumper job if
# a comma-delimited list of environments (or a * for all of them) is appended
# to the !bump command, e.g.
#   !bump patch *
#   !bump minor production
#   !bump major dev,staging
